  <p>My online course ‘How Not To Think Like Sherlock Holmes’ has finally started. This is based on an idea that I had years ago, that I’ve invested quite a lot in, in bits and pieces over time, and the fact that it’s finally underway feels like kind of a big deal. The strange thing is that it shouldn’t be a big deal. Teaching an online class of this kind is well within my abilities.</p>

  <p>Here’s what I’ve been reading in July:
Novels
The Passion, Jeanette Winterson
It’s atmospheric and poetic and sensual and basically it’s Written on the Body again, but with Bonaparte and Venecian boatmen, and it leads me to believe that Winterson has a thing for women with red hair. I liked it, but it’s possible that I needed a longer gap after reading Written on the Body in order to enjoy it properly, because I was very aware of the similarities.</p>

  <p>Houseboats need paint. They need quite a lot of paint, quite often. I got some advice when I first bought the boat: figure out how much you can get done in an hour, or half an hour, including setting up your equipment and cleaning it and putting it away. Do this because you will often have an hour to paint, but you will far less often have a day to do it.</p>

  <p>I find the relationship between philosophy and therapy fascinating, problematic, and potentially dangerous. First let’s unpack what the relationship is, and I’ll show you what I mean.
Firstly, and least controversially in my view, there are qualified therapists who openly use philosophy as part of their toolkit. The most typical example of this is existentialist psychotherapy, which draws on existentialist philosophical texts, and frames client’s experiences around ‘existential anxiety’ about freedom and responsibility, death, isolation, and meaning/meaninglessness .</p>

  <p>Forgive the self-indulgence of this entry. I am genuinely trying to work out the answer to this question.
I, like many, adopted this notebook blog inspired by David MacIver, who makes a convincing case for the value of writing daily. This blog was initially intended to be a daily blog, and for the first month, full of enthusiasm for a new project, it almost was. The intensity has dialled down a bit since.</p>

  <p>In Part Three of this series, I illustrated the problems with the classic Holmesian claim that ‘when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.’ Douglas Adams’ position that we might in fact be more justified in believing the ‘impossible’ than the extremely improbable, rests on the idea that to believe the ‘impossible’ is simply to believe that there is something we don’t know about, that there are layers to this that don’t meet the eye.</p>

  <p>Ivo Wever (@Confusionist) offered the following objection to yesterday’s post:
Could Krauss be ‘sincere, inconsistent and wrong’ instead of ‘a bullshitter’? He may not have realized he had given insufficient thought to the matter until strongly challenged? If motivation doesn’t matter, aren’t we all bullshitters at times?

  <p>Ever wake up in the morning having an imaginary intellectual argument with an imaginary person in which you are definitely right? This is a very literal version of ‘phantom opinions’ and it happens to me all the time. Most of my greatest intellectual successes occur in this world. I am astonishingly convincing.
Let’s test one of them here to see if it actually works, though.
So. Philosophy sometimes takes a battering from the scientific/rationalist/new-atheist crowd for, essentially, not being science.</p>

  <p>Kant’s two formulations of the categorical imperative are:
“Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law”.“Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of another, always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means.”In order for your actions to be moral, you have to be able to rationally desire a world where everyone would act in this way, and you have to treat people (including yourself) as intrinsically valuable.</p>

  <p>A recommendation/challenge has emerged from Dr Olivia Rissland on Twitter to read one academic article a day and keep a record of it
On Jan 1, 2018, I decided to read more papers and started trying to read a paper a day. As of today, I have read 899 papers in 899 days. I never would have imagined 2.5 years ago how much I would learn through this and how this would make me a better scientist and human.</p>
