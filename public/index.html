  <p>Forgive the summer holiday absence! We’re back…
Imagine the following scenario: a teacher, talking to her class of six-year-olds about the solar system, explains that the sun is made of burning gas.
However, the teacher is sufficiently knowledgeable about chemistry to be aware that, in fact, the sun is composed of plasma. The electrons in plasma are not bound to the nucleus as they are in a gas, so plasma is a fourth state of matter.</p>

  <p>I’ve spoken before about falsificationism and foundherentism, but I’ve recently noticed a rather lovely contrast between the epistemic approaches of Thales of Miletus and the Insane Clown Posse which illustrates both pretty well.
So to start, here’s a brief refresher. Falsificationism, as put forward by Karl Popper, is the idea that science doesn’t advance by conjectures being proven correct, but by them being falsified; or else by our best attempts to falsify them failing, at which point we can be justified in treating the conjectures as true - although we haven’t proven them to be true, as they may later turn out to be false.</p>

  <p>I met Joseph Merrick the way most people do, which is via the David Lynch film adaptation The Elephant Man; in my case closely followed by reading the original text it was based on, namely The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences by Dr. Frederick Treves. The film adaptation follows Treves’ account relatively faithfully in spirit, although it does swap around the order of events for dramatic effect, and give Merrick a far more comprehensible speaking voice than he actually had (for understandable practical reasons) and with it an inexplicably middle-class accent.</p>

  <p>My online course ‘How Not To Think Like Sherlock Holmes’ has finally started. This is based on an idea that I had years ago, that I’ve invested quite a lot in, in bits and pieces over time, and the fact that it’s finally underway feels like kind of a big deal. The strange thing is that it shouldn’t be a big deal. Teaching an online class of this kind is well within my abilities.</p>

  <p>Here’s what I’ve been reading in July:
Novels
The Passion, Jeanette Winterson
It’s atmospheric and poetic and sensual and basically it’s Written on the Body again, but with Bonaparte and Venecian boatmen, and it leads me to believe that Winterson has a thing for women with red hair. I liked it, but it’s possible that I needed a longer gap after reading Written on the Body in order to enjoy it properly, because I was very aware of the similarities.</p>

  <p>Houseboats need paint. They need quite a lot of paint, quite often. I got some advice when I first bought the boat: figure out how much you can get done in an hour, or half an hour, including setting up your equipment and cleaning it and putting it away. Do this because you will often have an hour to paint, but you will far less often have a day to do it.</p>

  <p>I find the relationship between philosophy and therapy fascinating, problematic, and potentially dangerous. First let’s unpack what the relationship is, and I’ll show you what I mean.
Firstly, and least controversially in my view, there are qualified therapists who openly use philosophy as part of their toolkit. The most typical example of this is existentialist psychotherapy, which draws on existentialist philosophical texts, and frames client’s experiences around ‘existential anxiety’ about freedom and responsibility, death, isolation, and meaning/meaninglessness .</p>

  <p>Forgive the self-indulgence of this entry. I am genuinely trying to work out the answer to this question.
I, like many, adopted this notebook blog inspired by David MacIver, who makes a convincing case for the value of writing daily. This blog was initially intended to be a daily blog, and for the first month, full of enthusiasm for a new project, it almost was. The intensity has dialled down a bit since.</p>

  <p>In Part Three of this series, I illustrated the problems with the classic Holmesian claim that ‘when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.’ Douglas Adams’ position that we might in fact be more justified in believing the ‘impossible’ than the extremely improbable, rests on the idea that to believe the ‘impossible’ is simply to believe that there is something we don’t know about, that there are layers to this that don’t meet the eye.</p>

  <p>Ivo Wever (@Confusionist) offered the following objection to yesterday’s post:
Could Krauss be ‘sincere, inconsistent and wrong’ instead of ‘a bullshitter’? He may not have realized he had given insufficient thought to the matter until strongly challenged? If motivation doesn’t matter, aren’t we all bullshitters at times?
