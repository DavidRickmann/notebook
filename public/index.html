  <p>I really didn’t want to write The Trouble with Lists.
This is because:
It describes a genuine problem for me. I actually do physically write these lists, and find it soothing to do so, and then (this is not made explicit in the piece but is kinda obvious) feel pressurized and frustrated afterwards. I am sufficiently inexperienced at writing in public that this feels like personal information.
The fact that nice crisp stationery is a trigger for this is really specific, and it’s weird.</p>

  <p>I find the physical act of handwriting soothing. Typing is more efficient and I can keep track of my work better once I’ve done it, but for some things only pen and paper will do. Preferably, WhSmiths A4 narrow-lined paper, and a Uniball Eye Fine pen in black. Wide-lined paper will do at a pinch, but if forced to use a standard ballpoint I will do so with displeasure. When I’m marking, despite the fact that the university system will have the details, I will write down names or ID numbers, record the grades, collate data on how many fell into each grade boundary.</p>

  <p>Thomas Kuhn, in the Structure of Scientific Revolutions, suggests the science does not accumulate knowledge in a linear way. Instead there are periods of ‘normal science’, in which scientists work within a paradigm (e.g. Newtonian physics) to solve puzzles. Eventually anomalous results build up which challenge the paradigm, but scientists are not inclined to abandon the paradigm unless a rival paradigm is available. A scientist adopting a new paradigm is a radical intellectual shift.</p>

  <p>I find the thought of doing epistemology without talking about education faintly bizarre. Theory of knowledge, even at its most abstract, seems so deeply connected to theories of learning that it surprises me how distinct the fields are in practice. For this piece I’m going to play around with the traditional, tripartite definition of knowledge just to see how each of the three elements maps onto educational practices.
&#8853; Note, I am well aware of the limitations of the tripartite definition of knowledge, and not only because of Gettier but it’s not not useful and it’s fun to play with it here.</p>

  <p>My plan is for the last entry of every month to be a record of the reading I’ve done that month. I’m not going to attempt anything significant in terms of reviews unless the mood takes me, but I’ll include at least a line or two of description.This is what I’ve read in May:
NovelsConfessions of the Fox, Jordy Rosenburg.Compellingly strange, half written in footnotes, this is two novels in one.</p>

  <p>In the Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty rejects Cartesian dualism. He explores the case of a First World War veteran, Schneider, who suffered a brain injury caused by shrapnel. Schneider wasn’t paralysed, but he was disconnected from his own body. He lost proprioception, and had to look at, find, his limbs before moving them. He operated his body from the inside, as though it were a machine. Merleau-Ponty contrasts Schneider’s experience of his body and the more typical experience to demonstrate that our bodies are not machines operated by the brain, that they aren’t in fact objects at all, but subjects.</p>

  <p>The Problem of Induction, initially presented by David Hume, is that since scientific knowledge is founded on experience, we are not justified in believing that the causal patterns we have thus far witnessed will continue in the future, or that they apply in parts of space we have not directly observed. Proving scientific theories to be true is therefore impossible. Karl Popper responds by arguing that the distinctive feature of scientific claims is not that they can be verified but that they can be falsified.</p>

  <p>As I mentioned in my last post, I’m fond of informal logic. However I’m aware that as a field, informal logic can suffer from its formal logic ancestry. Philosophers who cut their teeth on notation may wish to translate the skill into assessing ordinary language arguments, but they may drag too much formality along with them. Notably, there is a temptation to focus on fallacies. Teachers like them because they are neat and tidy and easy to test on; students like them because they have a favourable effort-to-‘feeling clever’ ratio.</p>

  <p>I have a comfort zone in philosophy: epistemology and ethics. Within those, I like my questions pretty applied. I like questions about the nature of knowledge; but I immediately want to relate them to questions about good and bad ways of pursuing knowledge (philosophy of science and social science) or disseminating it (philosophy of education, social epistemology). I am interested in ethics, but I prefer applied ethics, where you are trying to solve particular ethical problems and bring in different ethical systems as tools to do it, to ‘straight’ ethics, which involves studying the systems themselves in great depth - especially as the subtext of such study is often ‘choose between these,’ and consistency is the enemy.</p>

  <p>Hume’s Fork divides ‘relations of ideas’ from ‘matters of fact’. Relations of ideas are things we know to be true because of how concepts relate to each other, and we know them by understanding the concepts (e.g. ‘bachelors are unmarried’.) &#8853; I once knew a lecturer, who in a desire to be mildly original, changed this classic example to ‘every husband has a wife’. No one told him.  Matters of fact are true because of how the world is, and we know them through experience of the world (e.</p>
