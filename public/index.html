  <p>I have a comfort zone in philosophy: epistemology and ethics. Within those, I like my questions pretty applied. I like questions about the nature of knowledge; but I immediately want to relate them to questions about good and bad ways of pursuing knowledge (philosophy of science and social science) or disseminating it (philosophy of education, social epistemology). I am interested in ethics, but I prefer applied ethics, where you are trying to solve particular ethical problems and bring in different ethical systems as tools to do it, to ‘straight’ ethics, which involves studying the systems themselves in great depth - especially as the subtext of such study is often ‘choose between these,’ and consistency is the enemy.</p>

  <p>Hume’s Fork divides ‘relations of ideas’ from ‘matters of fact’. Relations of ideas are things we know to be true because of how concepts relate to each other, and we know them by understanding the concepts (e.g. ‘bachelors are unmarried’.) &#8853; I once knew a lecturer, who in a desire to be mildly original, changed this classic example to ‘every husband has a wife’. No one told him.  Matters of fact are true because of how the world is, and we know them through experience of the world (e.</p>

  <p>For the uninitiated, a ‘drabble’ is a work of fiction of exactly 100 words long, which is intended to test the writer’s ability to express interesting ideas in a confined space. I am experimenting here with using the format to explain philosophical concepts. This may become something I use as writing prompts for days when I am short of time and spoons.
(This isn’t the drabble yet. The next paragraph is the drabble.</p>

  <p>Holmes’ approach to reasoning can be summed up in the famous phrase:
‘When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.’
This is known as the Holmesian Fallacy, and there are a number of ways in which it is wrong.
A. It requires you to identify every potential explanation for the observed phenomenon,
B. It requires you to demonstrate that all but one of those is impossible,</p>

  <p>It’s a Philosophy Society day today, and we are going to be talking about justice and fairness. I’ve sent round some readings from Rawls and Nozick, and I’ll use this writing session as a bit of a refresher. I’m just gonna focus on Rawls though.
Rawls is inspired by Locke, in the sense that he finds his idea of ‘natural’ or ‘basic’ and ‘inalienable’ rights attractive and wants to retain that concept.</p>

  <p>Helen Longino is a social epistemologist and a philosopher of science, interested in establishing what it takes for the consensus of a research group to count as knowledge. According to Longino, knowledge ‘is constructed not by individuals, but by an interactive dialogic community’ (Longino 1994: 143). In short, knowledge arises from dialogue, but not just any form of dialogue. The interactions between members of a cognitive community must amount to ‘genuine and mutual checks’ if the group’s enquiries are to be objective.</p>

  <p>Parenthood sucks for hobbies. The first few years of a child’s life are overwhelming in the focus that they demand from you. It’s very easy to lose things, small and significant, which are part of who you are. So a few months ago, I began something of a reclamation project. This was a conscious effort to reclaim things that used to bring me joy and which I had somewhat abandoned.</p>

  <p>I am something of an apologist for Locke. An archetypal empiricist, Locke believes that all the knowledge we have is gained through our experiences; either through sensations, or through reflections upon sensations. This seems broadly intuitively true to the modern ear. (The alternative, that some knowledge is innate, is not actually disproved by Locke in the Essay Concerning Human Understanding, but it is discredited by providing an alternative, empiricist explanation for all the knowledge we have.</p>

  <p>We bought way too much food for my daughter’s birthday. We ended up surrounded by a dangerous amount of leftover sandwiches and cake. Then after she was asleep, I had a watch party with friends. The sensible thing would have been to gather a sort of picnic dinner. It was, however, the last thing I wanted. I was craving vegetables, I was craving spice, and if I was going to have anything like that, I needed to make it in a short enough time that I wouldn’t miss much of the watch party.</p>
