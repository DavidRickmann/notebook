  <p>In Should we take the friendships of children seriously?, Healy presents the three forms of Aristotelian friendship. Firstly: ‘friendships of utility’, which perform a function, such as ‘someone to play with’. Secondly: ‘friendships of pleasure’, deeply felt and yet often transitory: whilst you enjoy their presence, you don’t regret their absence. Finally there are ‘character friendships’: committed friendships where the flourishing of one friend is interconnected with the flourishing of the other.</p>

  <p>Lockdown has produced in me, as it has in many people, a certain urge to Use the Time for Self-Improvement. This has, amongst other things, included a significant up-swing in the amount of reading I’ve done. I was very much a reader when I was younger, but a combination of parenting a small child, an obligation to read a lot for work, and the ease of screentime, have drastically diminished the amount I read for recreation.</p>

  <p>I am going to do something deeply uncharacteristic here. I’m going to coin a term for a fallacy. Yes yes, I know, but consistency is the enemy even here. Whilst I maintain that being able to describe this argumentative problem is better than being able to name it, perhaps the existence of a name is nonetheless a hermeneutical tool of some use. Let’s find out.
There is a phrase I keep coming across, in conversation, in student essays, and sometimes even in academic papers, which goes something like this:</p>

  <p>As someone with a philosophy background who has recently come to work in an education department, I am teaching - and more recently, marking papers - in areas that I am not an expert in myself. This wasn’t such an issue in the first term, as I was teaching one general introduction/student skills course, and one philosophy of education course. It was relatively straightforward to adapt to these. However, one of the courses I am marking this term requires me to assess research portfolios including a semi-structured interview.</p>

  <p>The concept of unknown unknowns is something that I will come back to in the last section of my Sherlock series, but for now I’m just going to give it a brief spell in the spotlight by itself, and introduce a related concept of my own: ‘unknown knowns’.
The phrase ‘unknown unknowns’ comes from a response that Donald Rumsfeld gave to a question put to him at a US Department of Defence news briefing.</p>

  <p>Something odd is happening to me. I seem to be developing routines.
(This is a young and delicate flower and may not live long, I make no promises whatsoever).
Now, I hate routines. One reason I hate them because of how easily they can fail. Particularly they can fail if you are a parent. It is not possible to predict when a child will ask for help, a snack, or just generally some attention, so if you are committed to doing certain things in a certain order (self-care routines, housework, working from home) then you will be perpetually frustrated by your inability to do so.</p>

  <p>The latest in my ongoing project to ruin Sherlock Holmes’ reputation: Holmes tries to think by himself, and this is a terrible idea.
The longer way of saying this is that Holmes’ reasoning skills are compromised by his epistemic isolation. This comes in two forms. The first is an extreme degree of specialisation, accompanied by a more general ignorance (which he deliberately chooses). The second, connected issue is the social isolation that arises from his ‘solitary genius’ status, which prevents him benefiting from full membership in an epistemic community.</p>

  <p>Foundationalism holds that certain beliefs are self-evident. Other beliefs are justified with reference to these. According to coherentism, foundational beliefs don’t exist. Instead beliefs justify each other, like puzzle pieces fitting together. Haack argues that scientific investigation actually progresses like completing a crossword puzzle: it needs foundations (observations) and coherence (an overall theory). You read the clue (look at the results of your experiment), and complete the answer. If it doesn’t fit with other answers already completed, first check the clue again (for a potential anomaly); only then check the accuracy of the other answers (overall theory).</p>

  <p>In his influential article “Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?”, Gettier offers examples of justified true beliefs which don’t appear to be knowledge. My own invented ‘Gettier’ problem: suppose that you are on a high street where unbeknownest to you, an Autons episode of Doctor Who is about to be filmed. You believe you’re looking at a mannequin, it’s true that you are, and the belief is justified (this shop window usually has mannequins in it).</p>

  <p>I really didn’t want to write The Trouble with Lists.
This is because:
It describes a genuine problem for me. I actually do physically write these lists, and find it soothing to do so, and then (this is not made explicit in the piece but is kinda obvious) feel pressurized and frustrated afterwards. I am sufficiently inexperienced at writing in public that this feels like personal information.
The fact that nice crisp stationery is a trigger for this is really specific, and it’s weird.</p>
