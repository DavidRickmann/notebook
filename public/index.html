  <p>Something odd is happening to me. I seem to be developing routines.
(This is a young and delicate flower and may not live long, I make no promises whatsoever).
Now, I hate routines. One reason I hate them because of how easily they can fail. Particularly they can fail if you are a parent. It is not possible to predict when a child will ask for help, a snack, or just generally some attention, so if you are committed to doing certain things in a certain order (self-care routines, housework, working from home) then you will be perpetually frustrated by your inability to do so.</p>

  <p>The latest in my ongoing project to ruin Sherlock Holmes’ reputation: Holmes tries to think by himself, and this is a terrible idea.
The longer way of saying this is that Holmes’ reasoning skills are compromised by his epistemic isolation. This comes in two forms. The first is an extreme degree of specialisation, accompanied by a more general ignorance (which he deliberately chooses). The second, connected issue is the social isolation that arises from his ‘solitary genius’ status, which prevents him benefiting from full membership in an epistemic community.</p>

  <p>Foundationalism holds that certain beliefs are self-evident. Other beliefs are justified with reference to these. According to coherentism, foundational beliefs don’t exist. Instead beliefs justify each other, like puzzle pieces fitting together. Haack argues that scientific investigation actually progresses like completing a crossword puzzle: it needs foundations (observations) and coherence (an overall theory). You read the clue (look at the results of your experiment), and complete the answer. If it doesn’t fit with other answers already completed, first check the clue again (for a potential anomaly); only then check the accuracy of the other answers (overall theory).</p>

  <p>In his influential article “Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?”, Gettier offers examples of justified true beliefs which don’t appear to be knowledge. My own invented ‘Gettier’ problem: suppose that you are on a high street where unbeknownest to you, an Autons episode of Doctor Who is about to be filmed. You believe you’re looking at a mannequin, it’s true that you are, and the belief is justified (this shop window usually has mannequins in it).</p>

  <p>I really didn’t want to write The Trouble with Lists.
This is because:
It describes a genuine problem for me. I actually do physically write these lists, and find it soothing to do so, and then (this is not made explicit in the piece but is kinda obvious) feel pressurized and frustrated afterwards. I am sufficiently inexperienced at writing in public that this feels like personal information.
The fact that nice crisp stationery is a trigger for this is really specific, and it’s weird.</p>

  <p>I find the physical act of handwriting soothing. Typing is more efficient and I can keep track of my work better once I’ve done it, but for some things only pen and paper will do. Preferably, WhSmiths A4 narrow-lined paper, and a Uniball Eye Fine pen in black. Wide-lined paper will do at a pinch, but if forced to use a standard ballpoint I will do so with displeasure. When I’m marking, despite the fact that the university system will have the details, I will write down names or ID numbers, record the grades, collate data on how many fell into each grade boundary.</p>

  <p>Thomas Kuhn, in the Structure of Scientific Revolutions, suggests the science does not accumulate knowledge in a linear way. Instead there are periods of ‘normal science’, in which scientists work within a paradigm (e.g. Newtonian physics) to solve puzzles. Eventually anomalous results build up which challenge the paradigm, but scientists are not inclined to abandon the paradigm unless a rival paradigm is available. A scientist adopting a new paradigm is a radical intellectual shift.</p>

  <p>I find the thought of doing epistemology without talking about education faintly bizarre. Theory of knowledge, even at its most abstract, seems so deeply connected to theories of learning that it surprises me how distinct the fields are in practice. For this piece I’m going to play around with the traditional, tripartite definition of knowledge just to see how each of the three elements maps onto educational practices.
&#8853; Note, I am well aware of the limitations of the tripartite definition of knowledge, and not only because of Gettier but it’s not not useful and it’s fun to play with it here.</p>

  <p>My plan is for the last entry of every month to be a record of the reading I’ve done that month. I’m not going to attempt anything significant in terms of reviews unless the mood takes me, but I’ll include at least a line or two of description.This is what I’ve read in May:
NovelsConfessions of the Fox, Jordy Rosenburg.Compellingly strange, half written in footnotes, this is two novels in one.</p>

  <p>In the Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty rejects Cartesian dualism. He explores the case of a First World War veteran, Schneider, who suffered a brain injury caused by shrapnel. Schneider wasn’t paralysed, but he was disconnected from his own body. He lost proprioception, and had to look at, find, his limbs before moving them. He operated his body from the inside, as though it were a machine. Merleau-Ponty contrasts Schneider’s experience of his body and the more typical experience to demonstrate that our bodies are not machines operated by the brain, that they aren’t in fact objects at all, but subjects.</p>
