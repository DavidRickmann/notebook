  <p>For the uninitiated, a ‘drabble’ is a work of fiction of exactly 100 words long, which is intended to test the writer’s ability to express interesting ideas in a confined space. I am experimenting here with using the format to explain philosophical concepts. This may become something I use as writing prompts for days when I am short of time and spoons.
(This isn’t the drabble yet. The next paragraph is the drabble.</p>

  <p>Holmes’ approach to reasoning can be summed up in the famous phrase:
‘When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.’
This is known as the Holmesian Fallacy, and there are a number of ways in which it is wrong.
A. It requires you to identify every potential explanation for the observed phenomenon,
B. It requires you to demonstrate that all but one of those is impossible,</p>

&#8853; Jackson J.E., Green L. (2005) Tense and Aspectual be in Child African American English. In: Verkuyl H.J., de Swart H., van Hout A. (eds) Perspectives on Aspect. Studies in Theoretical Psycholinguistics, vol 32. Springer, Dordrecht  Janice E. Jackson and Lisa Green conducted research on a group of primary school students in Massachusetts. Some of the students were white, some black.</p>

  <p>It’s a Philosophy Society day today, and we are going to be talking about justice and fairness. I’ve sent round some readings from Rawls and Nozick, and I’ll use this writing session as a bit of a refresher. I’m just gonna focus on Rawls though.
Rawls is inspired by Locke, in the sense that he finds his idea of ‘natural’ or ‘basic’ and ‘inalienable’ rights attractive and wants to retain that concept.</p>

  <p>Helen Longino is a social epistemologist and a philosopher of science, interested in establishing what it takes for the consensus of a research group to count as knowledge. According to Longino, knowledge ‘is constructed not by individuals, but by an interactive dialogic community’ (Longino 1994: 143). In short, knowledge arises from dialogue, but not just any form of dialogue. The interactions between members of a cognitive community must amount to ‘genuine and mutual checks’ if the group’s enquiries are to be objective.</p>

  <p>Parenthood sucks for hobbies. The first few years of a child’s life are overwhelming in the focus that they demand from you. It’s very easy to lose things, small and significant, which are part of who you are. So a few months ago, I began something of a reclamation project. This was a conscious effort to reclaim things that used to bring me joy and which I had somewhat abandoned.</p>

  <p>I am something of an apologist for Locke. An archetypal empiricist, Locke believes that all the knowledge we have is gained through our experiences; either through sensations, or through reflections upon sensations. This seems broadly intuitively true to the modern ear. (The alternative, that some knowledge is innate, is not actually disproved by Locke in the Essay Concerning Human Understanding, but it is discredited by providing an alternative, empiricist explanation for all the knowledge we have.</p>

  <p>We bought way too much food for my daughter’s birthday. We ended up surrounded by a dangerous amount of leftover sandwiches and cake. Then after she was asleep, I had a watch party with friends. The sensible thing would have been to gather a sort of picnic dinner. It was, however, the last thing I wanted. I was craving vegetables, I was craving spice, and if I was going to have anything like that, I needed to make it in a short enough time that I wouldn’t miss much of the watch party.</p>

  <p>A computer told me to take a degree in philosophy.
Seriously. When I was doing my ‘A’ levels, my school handed out a multiple choice quiz for us to complete about our interests and preferences, which was intended to help us choose a university degree. The quizzes were read and analyzed electronically and recommendations were sent back to us. My second hit was English Literature, which was no surprise, since I was doing an ‘A’ level in that, and had got an A at GCSE.</p>

  <p>There is a trope common in popular culture about making decisions. It goes like this:
Girlfriend: I’m hungry.
Boyfriend: What would you like to eat?
Girlfriend: I don’t mind, you choose.
Boyfriend: Mexican?
Girlfriend: No, not Mexican, actually. I’m not in the mood for anything spicy.
Boyfriend: Pizza, then?
Girlfriend: Mmm, maybe not?
&#8853; This particular dynamic is super-gendered in the popular imagination so I’ve left that in place here, although I’m uncertain how gendered it actually is.</p>
