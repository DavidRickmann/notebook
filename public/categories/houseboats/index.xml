      <description>I like to joke that houseboats ruin all metaphors. Examples include:
Are you on board? No, but I’ll be home in a bit.
Let’s push the boat out! But we’d need to get longer standoffs and it would take all afternoon, can we not?
Wouldn’t touch you with a six foot barge pole! Well, good, it’s all covered in river goop.
I’ll show you the ropes!</description>
