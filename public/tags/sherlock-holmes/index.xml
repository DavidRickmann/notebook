      <description>So yesterday I analysed the argumentative structure of a section of the argument put forward by Sherlock in the Study in Pink. One of the purposes of this exercise was to illustrate various argument structures: it’s a good way of demonstrating what deduction actually is, what deductively valid and deductively sound arguments are, and what inductively forceful arguments are. The other purpose, however, was to illustrate the discrepancy between how good Sherlock’s arguments are perceived to be by others, and how good they actually are.</description>

      <description>I used to teach an informal logic class at a small university not far from Baker Street Station, and there is basically no way to be in that exact situation and not make some use of Sherlock Holmes. At the moment I’m expanding on the materials I used there to create a four-week online course, and also a corporate workshop (the latter obviously being for the After Times). I’m gonna use this format to play with some of the ideas.</description>
