      <description>Thomas Kuhn, in the Structure of Scientific Revolutions, suggests the science does not accumulate knowledge in a linear way. Instead there are periods of ‘normal science’, in which scientists work within a paradigm (e.g. Newtonian physics) to solve puzzles. Eventually anomalous results build up which challenge the paradigm, but scientists are not inclined to abandon the paradigm unless a rival paradigm is available. A scientist adopting a new paradigm is a radical intellectual shift.</description>

      <title>Drabble - The Problem of Induction and Falsificationism</title>

      <description>The Problem of Induction, initially presented by David Hume, is that since scientific knowledge is founded on experience, we are not justified in believing that the causal patterns we have thus far witnessed will continue in the future, or that they apply in parts of space we have not directly observed. Proving scientific theories to be true is therefore impossible. Karl Popper responds by arguing that the distinctive feature of scientific claims is not that they can be verified but that they can be falsified.</description>
