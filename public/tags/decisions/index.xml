      <description>A computer told me to take a degree in philosophy.
Seriously. When I was doing my ‘A’ levels, my school handed out a multiple choice quiz for us to complete about our interests and preferences, which was intended to help us choose a university degree. The quizzes were read and analyzed electronically and recommendations were sent back to us. My second hit was English Literature, which was no surprise, since I was doing an ‘A’ level in that, and had got an A at GCSE.</description>

      <description>There is a trope common in popular culture about making decisions. It goes like this:
Girlfriend: I’m hungry.
Boyfriend: What would you like to eat?
Girlfriend: I don’t mind, you choose.
Boyfriend: Mexican?
Girlfriend: No, not Mexican, actually. I’m not in the mood for anything spicy.
Boyfriend: Pizza, then?
Girlfriend: Mmm, maybe not?
&amp;#8853; This particular dynamic is super-gendered in the popular imagination so I’ve left that in place here, although I’m uncertain how gendered it actually is.</description>
