      <description>I find the physical act of handwriting soothing. Typing is more efficient and I can keep track of my work better once Iâ€™ve done it, but for some things only pen and paper will do. Preferably, WhSmiths A4 narrow-lined paper, and a Uniball Eye Fine pen in black. Wide-lined paper will do at a pinch, but if forced to use a standard ballpoint I will do so with displeasure.</description>
