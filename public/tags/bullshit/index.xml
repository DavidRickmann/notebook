      <description>Ivo Wever (@Confusionist) offered the following objection to yesterday’s post:
Could Krauss be ‘sincere, inconsistent and wrong’ instead of ‘a bullshitter’? He may not have realized he had given insufficient thought to the matter until strongly challenged? If motivation doesn’t matter, aren’t we all bullshitters at times?

      <description>Ever wake up in the morning having an imaginary intellectual argument with an imaginary person in which you are definitely right? This is a very literal version of ‘phantom opinions’ and it happens to me all the time. Most of my greatest intellectual successes occur in this world. I am astonishingly convincing.
Let’s test one of them here to see if it actually works, though.
So. Philosophy sometimes takes a battering from the scientific/rationalist/new-atheist crowd for, essentially, not being science.</description>
