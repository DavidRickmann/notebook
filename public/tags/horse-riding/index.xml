      <description>I find the physical act of handwriting soothing. Typing is more efficient and I can keep track of my work better once I’ve done it, but for some things only pen and paper will do. Preferably, WhSmiths A4 narrow-lined paper, and a Uniball Eye Fine pen in black. Wide-lined paper will do at a pinch, but if forced to use a standard ballpoint I will do so with displeasure. When I’m marking, despite the fact that the university system will have the details, I will write down names or ID numbers, record the grades, collate data on how many fell into each grade boundary.</description>
