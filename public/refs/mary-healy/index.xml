      <description>In Should we take the friendships of children seriously?, Healy presents the three forms of Aristotelian friendship. Firstly: ‘friendships of utility’, which perform a function, such as ‘someone to play with’. Secondly: ‘friendships of pleasure’, deeply felt and yet often transitory: whilst you enjoy their presence, you don’t regret their absence. Finally there are ‘character friendships’: committed friendships where the flourishing of one friend is interconnected with the flourishing of the other.</description>
