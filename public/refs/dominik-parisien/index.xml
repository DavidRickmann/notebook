      <description>I met Joseph Merrick the way most people do, which is via the David Lynch film adaptation The Elephant Man; in my case closely followed by reading the original text it was based on, namely _The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences _by Dr. Frederick Treves. The film adaptation follows Treves’ account relatively faithfully in spirit, although it does swap around the order of events for dramatic effect, and give Merrick a far more comprehensible speaking voice than he actually had (for understandable practical reasons) and with it an inexplicably middle-class accent.</description>
