      <description>My online course ‘How Not To Think Like Sherlock Holmes’ has finally started. This is based on an idea that I had years ago, that I’ve invested quite a lot in, in bits and pieces over time, and the fact that it’s finally underway feels like kind of a big deal. The strange thing is that it shouldn’t be a big deal. Teaching an online class of this kind is well within my abilities.</description>

      <description>In Part Three of this series, I illustrated the problems with the classic Holmesian claim that ‘when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.’ Douglas Adams’ position that we might in fact be more justified in believing the ‘impossible’ than the extremely improbable, rests on the idea that to believe the ‘impossible’ is simply to believe that there is something we don’t know about, that there are layers to this that don’t meet the eye.</description>

      <description>The latest in my ongoing project to ruin Sherlock Holmes’ reputation: Holmes tries to think by himself, and this is a terrible idea.
The longer way of saying this is that Holmes’ reasoning skills are compromised by his epistemic isolation. This comes in two forms. The first is an extreme degree of specialisation, accompanied by a more general ignorance (which he deliberately chooses). The second, connected issue is the social isolation that arises from his ‘solitary genius’ status, which prevents him benefiting from full membership in an epistemic community.</description>

      <description>Holmes’ approach to reasoning can be summed up in the famous phrase:
‘When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.’
This is known as the Holmesian Fallacy, and there are a number of ways in which it is wrong.
A. It requires you to identify every potential explanation for the observed phenomenon,
B. It requires you to demonstrate that all but one of those is impossible,</description>

      <description>So yesterday I analysed the argumentative structure of a section of the argument put forward by Sherlock in the Study in Pink. One of the purposes of this exercise was to illustrate various argument structures: it’s a good way of demonstrating what deduction actually is, what deductively valid and deductively sound arguments are, and what inductively forceful arguments are. The other purpose, however, was to illustrate the discrepancy between how good Sherlock’s arguments are perceived to be by others, and how good they actually are.</description>

      <description>I used to teach an informal logic class at a small university not far from Baker Street Station, and there is basically no way to be in that exact situation and not make some use of Sherlock Holmes. At the moment I’m expanding on the materials I used there to create a four-week online course, and also a corporate workshop (the latter obviously being for the After Times). I’m gonna use this format to play with some of the ideas.</description>
