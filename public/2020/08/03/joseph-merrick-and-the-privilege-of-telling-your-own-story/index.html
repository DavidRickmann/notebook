<p>I met Merrick the way most people do, which is via the David Lynch film adaptation <em>The Elephant Man</em>; in my case closely followed by reading the original text it was based on, namely <em>The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences,</em> an autobiographical work by Dr. Frederick Treves. The film adaptation follows Treves’ account relatively faithfully in spirit, although it does swap around the order of events for dramatic effect, conflate different people into a single character, and get Joseph Merrick’s first name wrong (which to be fair, Treves does too, in places).</p>
<p>Main points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lynch film is an over-sentimentalised version of Treves’ account, which is ‘black and white’ in more senses than one,</li>
<li>Treves’ account is itself over-sentimentalised and also wildly self-serving,</li>
<li>Merrick wrote his own account of his life, which isn’t referred to by Treves or Lynch,</li>
<li><a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/pd-texts/the-autobiography-of-joseph-carey-merrick-1884">https://publicdomainreview.org/pd-texts/the-autobiography-of-joseph-carey-merrick-1884</a></li>
<li>That account, and a more detailed look at the events at Merrick’s life, suggest a more mature, capable, and resourceful person than either Treves’ account or the best-known fictional adaptation would give. He was reasonably well educated, attending school until he was 11. He worked in a cigarette factory until his deformity became too advanced for it to be possible. He then worked for a while as a pedlar - a door-to-door salesman! - which, unsurprisingly, did not go well. chose the freak shows to escape the workhouse. He initiated contact with the showmen himself. He made and saved a reasonable amount of money at those shows. He made his way back to England, alone, after being robbed and abandoned on the Continent. That is not the action of a naive child.</li>
<li>Pomerence’s play comes gives Merrick more intelligence and more agency, and</li>
