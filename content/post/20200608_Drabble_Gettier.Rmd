In his influential article “Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?”, Gettier offers examples of justified true beliefs which don’t appear to be knowledge. My own invented ‘Gettier’ problem: suppose that you are on a high street where unbeknownest to you, an Autons episode of Doctor Who is about to be filmed. You *believe* you’re looking at a mannequin, it’s *true* that you are, and the belief is *justified* (this shop window usually has mannequins in it). However, all the other ‘mannequins’ are actors in disguise. You picked the one remaining actual mannequin, so your justified true belief is mere good luck.
