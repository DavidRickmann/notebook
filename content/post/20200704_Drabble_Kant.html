<p>Kant’s two formulations of the categorical imperative are:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law”.</li>
<li>“Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of another, always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for your actions to be moral, you have to be able to rationally desire a world where everyone would act in this way, and you have to treat people (including yourself) as intrinsically valuable.</p>
