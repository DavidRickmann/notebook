<p>If you’ve enjoyed my posts on <a href="/series/how-not-to-think-like-sherlock-holmes/">How Not To Think Like Sherlock Holmes</a> you would probably also enjoy my online course, also called “How Not To Think Like Sherlock Holmes”</p>
<p>Come and discover the reasoning skills of the Master of Deduction. Just how does Sherlock Holmes come to his conclusions? How does he convince Scotland Yard that he is right? And is it wise of him to forget that the earth goes around the sun?</p>
<p>An exploration of critical thinking and epistemology through the magnifying lens of the great detective, intended to have you musing and amused.</p>
